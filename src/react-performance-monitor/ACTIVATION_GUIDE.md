# ðŸš€ React Performance Monitor - Activation Guide

## âš¡ HOTKEYS (Easiest Way!)

**No console needed!** Just press these keys anywhere on your page:

- **`Ctrl+Shift+P`** = Quick performance report (auto-copies!)

**That's it!** Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to get instant performance data. ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸŽ¯ Alternative: Console Commands

If you prefer typing commands, open browser console (`F12`):

```javascript
// Quick overview
perf.quick()

// Full details  
perf.summary()

// Copy to clipboard (with fallback)
perf.copy()

// Reset data
perf.reset()
```
