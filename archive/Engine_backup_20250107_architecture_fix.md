# Engine.ts Backup - Architecture Fix
**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Reason**: Backup before fixing the chain detonation architecture mismatch

**Root Cause Found**: 
The original implementation directly managed meteors in Engine.ts:
```typescript
// OLD WORKING VERSION in Engine.ts
this.activeMeteors.forEach(meteor => {
  if (meteor) {
    this.meteorPool.release(meteor);
  }
});
this.activeMeteors.length = 0;
```

**Current Broken Version**:
```typescript
// NEW BROKEN VERSION - delegates to GameLogic
const actualMeteorsDestroyed = gameLogic.clearAllMeteors();
```

**Issue**: The architecture changed to use EngineCore/GameLogic but the meteor destruction isn't properly synchronized between Engine.ts and GameLogic.ts.

**Solution**: Either restore direct access or fix the delegation properly.

This backup preserves the current state before the architecture fix.
