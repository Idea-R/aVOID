# ChainDetonationRenderer.ts Backup - 2025-01-07 16:15:00

## Reason for Backup
Fixing harsh "seizure warning" white flash effects in chain detonation completion. Making visual effects more appealing and less eye-bleeding.

## Issue Identified
In `renderCompletionEffect` method (lines 236-240), the screen flash uses harsh white at 80% opacity:

```typescript
// Screen flash
if (effect.flashIntensity > 0) {
  this.ctx.fillStyle = `rgba(255, 255, 255, ${effect.flashIntensity * 0.8})`;
  this.ctx.fillRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height);
}
```

This creates an extremely bright, harsh white flash that can:
- Cause eye strain and discomfort
- Trigger photosensitive reactions
- Be visually jarring and unpleasant
- Detract from the game experience

## Fix Strategy
- Replace harsh white flash with gentler colored gradient
- Use purple/cyan theme colors for consistency
- Reduce maximum opacity significantly  
- Create more visually appealing explosion effect
- Maintain impact while being eye-friendly
