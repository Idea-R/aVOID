# HUD.tsx Backup - 2025-01-07 16:25:00

## Reason for Backup
Adding the beautiful CyberpunkScoreDisplay component to replace the basic score text and provide engaging visual score tracking as requested.

## Issue Identified
The HUD currently shows a basic score display:
```jsx
<div className="text-lg font-semibold">Score: {score.toLocaleString()}</div>
```

But there's a beautiful CyberpunkScoreDisplay component that exists but isn't being used anywhere! This component features:
- Cyberpunk-themed design with circuit patterns
- Smooth score animation with leading zeros
- Different animation effects based on score increases
- Glitch effects for large increases
- Milestone celebration effects
- Holographic shimmer overlay
- Scan lines and circuit flow animations

## Fix Strategy
- Import CyberpunkScoreDisplay component
- Replace basic score text with cyberpunk component
- Position it in the top center as requested
- Ensure it doesn't conflict with other HUD elements
