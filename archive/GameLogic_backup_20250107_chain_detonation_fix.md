# GameLogic.ts Backup - Chain Detonation Fix
**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Reason**: Backup before fixing chain detonation meteor destruction bug where meteors weren't being properly destroyed due to array modification during iteration.

**Issue**: The `processChainDetonationScreenClear()` method was calling `releaseMeteor()` in a for...of loop, which modifies the `activeMeteors` array during iteration, causing some meteors to be skipped.

**Solution**: Process meteors from end to beginning using index-based loop, or create a copy of the array to iterate over.

Original method:
```typescript
// Handle complete screen clear from chain detonation
processChainDetonationScreenClear(): number {
  const meteorsDestroyed = this.activeMeteors.length;
  
  // Release all meteors properly
  for (const meteor of this.activeMeteors) {
    this.releaseMeteor(meteor);
    this.gameStats.meteorsDestroyed++;
  }
  
  return meteorsDestroyed;
}
```

This backup preserves the game logic state before the critical fix.
