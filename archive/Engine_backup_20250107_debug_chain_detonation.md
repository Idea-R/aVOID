# Engine.ts Backup - Chain Detonation Debug
**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Reason**: Backup before adding comprehensive debugging to troubleshoot chain detonation functionality

**Issue**: Chain detonation isn't destroying meteors or scoring properly
**Plan**: Add extensive console logging throughout the chain detonation flow to identify where it's breaking

**Chain Detonation Flow**:
1. ChainDetonationManager.triggerCompletion() dispatches 'chainDetonationComplete' event
2. Engine.handleChainDetonationComplete() receives event
3. Should call clearAllMeteors() to destroy meteors
4. Should call addChainDetonationScore() to add points
5. Should create particle explosion

Need to verify each step is working properly.

This backup preserves the current state before diagnostic debugging.
