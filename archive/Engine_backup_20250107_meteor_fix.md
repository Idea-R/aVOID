# Engine.ts Backup - 2025-01-07 16:10:00

## Reason for Backup
Critical gameplay bug: meteors are not being destroyed/removed when hit by power-up knockback effects. They create explosion effects but remain in the game world.

## Issue Identified
In `handleKnockbackActivation` method (lines 280-310), destroyed meteors are identified by collision system but never actually removed from the game:

```typescript
// Process destroyed meteors
for (const meteor of knockbackResult.destroyedMeteors) {
  this.engineCore.getParticleSystem().createExplosion(meteor.x, meteor.y, meteor.color, meteor.isSuper);
  // Note: GameLogic will handle meteor release and stats internally ‚Üê THIS IS WRONG!
}
```

The comment suggests GameLogic handles it, but GameLogic's update method only handles meteors destroyed by the defense system, not knockback system.

## Root Cause
Separation of concerns issue - knockback collision detection happens in Engine.ts but meteor lifecycle management is in GameLogic.ts. The destroyed meteors are never passed back to GameLogic for proper cleanup.

## Fix Strategy
- Add proper meteor release and stats tracking for knockback-destroyed meteors
- Ensure destroyed meteors are properly removed from activeMeteors array
- Maintain consistency with defense system destruction handling
