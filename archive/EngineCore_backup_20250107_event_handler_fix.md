# EngineCore.ts Backup - Event Handler Fix
**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Reason**: Critical bug fix for chain detonation event handler mismatch

**Major Issue Found**: 
- Event listener for `chainDetonationComplete` is set up in EngineCore.ts
- But the handler method `handleChainDetonationComplete` is defined in Engine.ts
- This means chain detonation completion events are **never being handled**!

**Current setup in EngineCore.ts**:
```typescript
window.addEventListener('chainDetonationComplete', this.handleChainDetonationComplete);
```

**Problem**: `this.handleChainDetonationComplete` doesn't exist in EngineCore class!

**Solution**: Either move the handler to EngineCore or change the event delegation pattern.

This backup preserves the state before fixing this critical event handling bug.
