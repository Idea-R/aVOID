### **Phase 2: Component Optimization (COMPLETED ✅)**

**Problem**: GameOverScreen.tsx approaching 500-line limit  
**Solution**: Extracted into specialized components

| Component | Lines | Purpose | Compliance |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| **GameOverScreen.tsx** | 296 | Main component coordinator | ✅ Under 400 |
| **ScoreDisplay.tsx** | 71 | Score breakdown & achievements | ✅ Under 100 |
| **PlayerRanking.tsx** | 27 | Rank display & messaging | ✅ Under 50 |
| **ScoreSaving.tsx** | 121 | Guest vs verified save flows | ✅ Under 150 |

**Benefits Achieved:**
- ✅ **33% reduction** in main component size
- ✅ **Reusable component architecture**
- ✅ **Improved maintainability**
- ✅ **Clear feature separation**
